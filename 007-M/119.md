# Boosted3TokenAuraVault and MetaStable2TokenAuraVault will only be usable until February 7, 2106

## Summary
Boosted3TokenAuraVault and MetaStable2TokenAuraVault will only be usable until February 7, 2106

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
context.baseStrategy.vaultState.lastSettlementTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
...
context.baseStrategy.vaultState.lastPostMaturitySettlementTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
...
context.baseStrategy.vaultState.lastSettlementTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
...
context.baseStrategy.vaultState.lastPostMaturitySettlementTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
```

block.timestamp is converted to uint32 which has a max value of 4294967295. 4294967295 is February 7, 2106. After February 7, 2106, uint32(block.timestamp) will be overflowed. Once it is overflowed, the logic of the contract will be broken.

## Impact
After February 7, 2106. Boosted3TokenAuraVault and MetaStable2TokenAuraVault won't be usable. Migration takes costs and is risky. You shouldn't pass on this work to future programmers. You should fix it in the first place. In case anything went wrong during migration, a big fund loss will occur.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use bigger uint to store timestamps such as uint40 or more
