# transfer should not be used for transferring ETH

## Summary
`transfer` is used in multiple places, leading to problems with smart contract wallets.

## Vulnerability Detail
The system uses `transfer` in multiple places. Because of the 2300 gas limit, this can lead to problems with smart contract wallets or integrations with other smart contracts, because they may have some logic in their `receive` function that consumes more gas.

## Impact
When a receiver uses more than 2300 gas in its `receive` function, retrieving the ETH will not be possible.
