# The check against `debtOutstandingAboveMinBorrow` in `_depositLiquidatorAmount` should be `<=` and not `<`

## Summary
The check against `debtOutstandingAboveMinBorrow` in `_depositLiquidatorAmount` should be `<=` and not `<`

## Vulnerability Detail
The `private` function `_depositLiquidatorAmount` is used by `deleverageAccount` in `VaultAccountAction.sol` to calculate the amount a liquidator must deposit in order to liquidate a specific vault account. As part of the calculation, `_depositLiquidatorAmount` checks to ensure that a partial liquidation does not put a vault account into a state where it would be under the minimum borrow capacity for the vault and subsequently unprofitable to liquidate again. To avoid unprofitable liquidations, a liquidator is required to leave at least the minimum borrow amount in a vault. Otherwise if this is not possible, then the liquidator must liquidate the entire borrow amount for a vault account:

```solidity
// NOTE: deposit amount external is always positive in this method
if (depositAmountExternal < maxLiquidatorDepositExternal) {
    // If liquidating past the debt outstanding above the min borrow, then the entire debt outstanding
    // must be liquidated (that is set to maxLiquidatorDepositExternal)
    require(depositAmountExternal < assetToken.convertToExternal(debtOutstandingAboveMinBorrow), "Must Liquidate All Debt");
} else {
    // In the other case, limit the deposited amount to the maximum
    depositAmountExternal = maxLiquidatorDepositExternal;
}
```

However, the `require` statement should use the comparison `<=` and not `<` as a vault account can borrow an amount equal to the minimum borrow for a vault (inclusive).

## Impact
While this does not greatly impact a liquidator's ability to liquidate vault accounts, liquidators usually look to extract the maximum value possible from a liquidation. This means liquidators who want to liquidate an account such that it is equivalent to the minimum borrow for a vault would have their transaction revert unexpectedly.

## Code Snippet
Failing test (add to `tests/stateful/vaults/test_vault_deleverage.py`):
```python3
def test_deleverage_account_min_balance(environment, accounts, vault):
    environment.notional.updateVault(
        vault.address,
        get_vault_config(currencyId=2, flags=set_flags(0, ENABLED=True)),
        100_000_000e8,
    )
    maturity = environment.notional.getActiveMarkets(1)[0][1]

    environment.notional.enterVault(
        accounts[1], vault.address, 50_000e18, maturity, 200_000e8, 0, "", {"from": accounts[1]}
    )

    vault.setExchangeRate(0.95e18)

    vaultConfig = environment.notional.getVaultConfig(vault.address)
    print(vaultConfig.dict())

    # Liquidator should be allowed to deleverage up to (inclusive) the minimum borrow amount for the vault
    environment.notional.deleverageAccount(
        accounts[1], vault.address, accounts[2], 5_000_000e8, False, "", {"from": accounts[2]}
    )
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing the comparison in the `require` statement from `<` to `<=`:

```solidity
require(depositAmountExternal <= assetToken.convertToExternal(debtOutstandingAboveMinBorrow), "Must Liquidate All Debt");
```
