# Price oracle could get a stale price

## Summary

`_calculateAnswer()` will get `baseAnswer` from Chainlink oracle. But it doesn't check round id and timestamp, leading to it may get a stale price from Chainlink oracle.

## Vulnerability Detail

In wstETHChainlinkOracle.sol, it check `baseAnswer` > 0, but it doesn't check for the stale price by `updateAt` and `roundId`.

## Impact

Price oracle could get a stale price without checking `roundId`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check `answer`, `updateAt` and `roundId` when getting price:

```
        (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracle.latestRoundData();

        require(updatedAt > 0, "Round is not complete");
        require(answer >= 0, "Malfunction");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
```
