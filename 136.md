# oracle : latestRoundData will not tell the latest price feed data.

## Summary
The implementation that was done in `wstETHChainlinkOracle.sol` to decide the price of token will not tell the latest price feed data.
The price data could be outdated.

I see the price feed data is used in other contracts as well.

## Vulnerability Detail
old price feed data can be used to decide the price of the token.
Either the price could be low or high. but it is not the latest data.

    function _calculateAnswer() internal view returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) {
        int256 baseAnswer;
        (
            roundId,
            baseAnswer,
            startedAt,
            updatedAt,
            answeredInRound
        ) = baseOracle.latestRoundData();
        require(baseAnswer > 0, "Chainlink Rate Error");


        answer = baseAnswer * wstETH.stEthPerToken().toInt() / baseDecimals;
    }

when we look at the price calculation, the data obtained could be `answeredInRound < roundId` which means that the data could be older one.

## Impact
The price feed data must be stale(old one) that can be used to fix the price of the token.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the codes as shown below while calculating the `latestRoundData`.
before calculating the `answer` validate for latest feed and add below check.
require(
            answeredInRound >= roundID,
            "RoundID from Oracle is outdated!"
        );
