# Boosted3TokenPoolMixin.sol : Three token's decimal could be different. The further calculation based on these decimal value will not be correct.

## Summary
Three token's decimal could be different. The further calculation based on these decimal value will not be correct.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the three token price mixings, the toke decimals for all tokens are validated such that whetehr they are lesser then or equal to 18. 
But the token decimals can be different. It is not always guaranteed that the token decimal will be same.

## Impact
decimal based data calculations will not be valid.
