# Notional Governors can use `reduceMaxBorrowCapacity` on a vault to increase `maxBorrowCapacity`, which can grief users of the vault.

## Summary
Notional Governors can increase the risk of a vault at any time by using `reduceMaxBorrowCapacity` to increase `maxBorrowCapacity`, which can lead to insolvency of users.

## Vulnerability Detail
`VaultAction.reduceMaxBorrowCapacity()` is meant to 
```
reduce the max borrow capacity on the vault and force
the redemption of strategy tokens to cash to reduce the overall risk of the vault.
This method is intended to be used in emergencies to mitigate insolvency risk. The effect
of this method will mean that the overall max borrow capacity is reduced, the total used
capacity will be unchanged (redeemStrategyTokensToCash does not do any lending to reduce
the outstanding fCash), and accounts will be locked out of entering the maturity which was
targeted by this method
```

The function calls [VaultConfiguration.setMaxBorrowCapacity](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/cf05d8e3e4e4feb0b0cef2c3f188c91cdaac38e0/contracts/external/actions/VaultAction.sol#L103), which sets the new `maxBorrowCapacity` **without any check on the new value being written.**

This means it is technically possible for Notional governors to actually **increase** the `maxBorrowCapacity`.

## Impact
As detailed in the function comment `Other maturities for that vault may still be entered depending on whether or not the vault is above or below the max vault borrow capacity.`
This would effectively increase the risk on users having entered the vaults on these other maturities:

The higher borrowing capacity means new accounts can keep borrowing, increasing [here](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/cf05d8e3e4e4feb0b0cef2c3f188c91cdaac38e0/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultState.sol#L283) `totalVaultShares`.


- `VaultState.getCashValueOfShare()` returns [assetCashValue](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/cf05d8e3e4e4feb0b0cef2c3f188c91cdaac38e0/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultState.sol#L330) which will be lower due to `getPoolShare` return values being lower as `vaultState.totalVaultShares` is [higher](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/cf05d8e3e4e4feb0b0cef2c3f188c91cdaac38e0/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultState.sol#L294-L295)
- In `VaultConfiguration.calculateCollateralRatio()`, `vaultShareValue` is lower , which also results in `netAssetValue` being lower. If too low: 
- either the account is insolvent
- if high enough to be `> 0`, the return value `collateralRatio` will trigger this [check](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/cf05d8e3e4e4feb0b0cef2c3f188c91cdaac38e0/contracts/external/actions/VaultAccountAction.sol#L280) to pass, meaning that the account can be liquidated.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`VaultConfiguration.setMaxBorrowCapacity` should check the new `maxBorrowCapacity` to ensure it is not greater than the current one.

```diff
        VaultBorrowCapacityStorage storage cap = LibStorage.getVaultBorrowCapacity()[vault][currencyId];
+       require(cap.maxBorrowCapacity > maxBorrowCapacity, "invalid new maxBorrowCapacity");
        cap.maxBorrowCapacity = maxBorrowCapacity;
```
