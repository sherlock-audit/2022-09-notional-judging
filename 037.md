# [NAZ-M1] Use `safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()` Instead of `transfer()/transferFrom()`

## Summary
There are a few uses of `transfer()/transferFrom()` when there should be the use of `safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is a good idea to add a `require()` statement that checks the return value of ERC20 token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelin’s `safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()` unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

However, using `require()` to check transfer return values could lead to issues with non-compliant ERC20 tokens which do not return a boolean value. Therefore, it's highly advised to use OpenZeppelin’s `safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()`.

## Impact
Use of `transfer()/transferFrom()` can can cause silent failures and affect token accounting in the contract.
