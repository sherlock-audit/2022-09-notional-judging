# Oracles With Different Quote Currency Can Be Used To Compute Price

## Summary

The price can be computed using oracles with different quote currency causing the price returned to be wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getOraclePrice` function will return the price between the baseToken and the quoteToken using Chainlink.

For each currency supported by Chainlink, there are usually two quote currencies (ETH and USD). For instance, based on https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=ethereum:

- USDC / ETH
- USDC / USD
- DAI / ETH
- DAI / USD

Based on the current implementation, it is extremely important that the quote currency is the same. Otherwise, the price returned by this function will be wrong. This point has also been stressed in the source code's comments as shown below.

221:         require(block.timestamp - bpUpdatedAt <= maxOracleFreshnessInSeconds);
222:         require(basePrice > 0); /// @dev: Chainlink Rate Error
223: 
224:         (/* */, int256 quotePrice, /* */, uint256 qpUpdatedAt, /* */) = quoteOracle.oracle.latestRoundData();

226:         require(quotePrice > 0); /// @dev: Chainlink Rate Error
227: 
228:         answer =
229:             (basePrice * quoteDecimals * RATE_DECIMALS) /
230:             (quotePrice * baseDecimals);
231:         decimals = RATE_DECIMALS;
232:     }
```

If the admin configured with a wrong quote currency for a price pair (e.g.  USDC/DAI pair using USDC / ETH + DAI / USD oracles), the price returned will be wrong, and all the assets within the vault will be either overvalued or undervalued leading to an array of issues. Even though it is critical to get this right, this requirement is not explicitly enforced within the codebase, and no validation is in place to ensure that quote currency between the two oracles is the same.

The following shows that the admin can set any price oracle by calling the `setPriceOracle` function. There is no validation in place to ensure that the quote currency of the oracles is standardized to either ETH or USD. The admin is free to configure an oracle with any quote currency.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/trading/TradingModule.sol#L64

```solidity
File: TradingModule.sol
64:     function setPriceOracle(address token, AggregatorV2V3Interface oracle) external override onlyNotionalOwner {
65:         PriceOracle storage oracleStorage = priceOracles[token];
66:         oracleStorage.oracle = oracle;
67:         oracleStorage.rateDecimals = oracle.decimals();
68: 
69:         emit PriceOracleUpdated(token, address(oracle));
70:     }
```

Furthermore, the `getOraclePrice` function did not perform any checks to ensure that the quote currency of the two oracles is the same. Even if the quote currency of the two oracles is different, the function will happily accept it and proceed to compute the price.

231:         decimals = RATE_DECIMALS;
232:     }
```

## Impact

If the price returned is wrong, the assets will be either overvalued or undervalued. This will lead to an array of serious issues such as over-borrowing and pre-matured liquidation.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing one of the following measures:

- Standardize the quote currency to either ETH or USD within the Trade Module. For example, standardize the quote currency to ETH within the Trade Module. If anyone attempts to add a price oracle with a USD quote currency via the `setPriceOracle` function, it will revert.
- Within the `getOraclePrice` function, reverts if the quote currency of the two oracles is different.

Currently, it really depends on the admin to get this right. However, the codebase will grow over time, developers join and leave the team, lack of communication between developers, a lack of proper internal documentation, or simply human errors, we have seen many mistakes made during deployment, configuring, and upgrading over the past few years leading to a security incident that can be avoided if proper validation has been implemented right at the start. Thus, it will be prudent for the team to implement this fix to prevent this issue.
