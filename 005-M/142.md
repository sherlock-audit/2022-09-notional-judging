# TwoTokenPoolMixin.sol : the token's decimals could not be same. Calculation based on token decimal will not give correct result.

## Summary
TwoTokenPoolMixin.sol : the token's decimals could not be same.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `TwoTokenPoolMixin.sol`,  primary and secondary token's decimals are set by checking that they should be <= 18. But they can be different.
When they are different, the calculation based on decimal values will not be correct.

## Impact
The calculation based on primary and secondary decimals will not give correct result.

## Recommendation
Add validation to check whether both of the token decimals are equal.
or
Do normalization of data based on the decimals while using them.
