# Flawed decimals check could lock funds in a 2-token Balancer Strategy Vault

## Summary
A flawed check for the decimals of the secondary token in the 2-token Balancer Strategy Vault contract allows to deploy a vault that uses a token with more than 18 decimals. Such vault, however, won't be able to settle due to a decimals check in `Stable2TokenOracleMath`. Thus, funds will remain locked in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [MetaStable2TokenAuraVault contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/MetaStable2TokenAuraVault.sol) inherits from [TwoTokenPoolMixin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/mixins/TwoTokenPoolMixin.sol). The strategy vault manages two tokens and deposits them in a Balancer vault. The strategy vault expects that both tokens have no more than 18 decimals:
1. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/mixins/TwoTokenPoolMixin.sol#L58
1. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/mixins/TwoTokenPoolMixin.sol#L65

However, the second check checks `primaryDecimals`, not `secondaryDecimals`.

During settlement, [the oracle of a Balancer vault is called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/external/MetaStable2TokenAuraHelper.sol#L94) to calculate tokens amounts for redeemed BPT tokens. The oracle [requires both tokens to have less than 19 decimals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/internal/math/Stable2TokenOracleMath.sol#L24). Thus, if the secondary token has more than 18 tokens (which is allowed by the flawed check during deployment), the `_getSpotPrice` function would always revert, as well as the settlement function.

## Impact
In the case when a vault is deployed and the secondary token is a token with more than 18 decimals, it won't be possible to settle the vault due to the price oracle of the related Balancer vault not allowing tokens with more than 18 decimals. Funds would remain locked in the strategy vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to fix the `secondaryDecimals` check in the constructor of `TwoTokenPoolMixin` to avoid such situations.
