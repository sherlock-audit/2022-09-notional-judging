# TwoTokenPoolMixin allows secondary token to have decimals >18 due to incorrect require statement

## Summary

TwoTokenPoolMixin incorrectly check the number of decimals on the secondary token allows it to have >18 decimals, which is explicitly incompatible

## Vulnerability Detail

[TwoTokenPoolMixin.sol#L61-L66](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/mixins/TwoTokenPoolMixin.sol#L61-L66)

    uint256 secondaryDecimals = address(SECONDARY_TOKEN) ==
        Deployments.ETH_ADDRESS
        ? 18
        : SECONDARY_TOKEN.decimals();
    require(primaryDecimals <= 18);
    SECONDARY_DECIMALS = uint8(secondaryDecimals);

In TwoTokenPoolMixin#constructor secondary tokens are supposed to be check to block tokens that have decimals >18. The require statement is incorrect and checks the decimals of the primary token again instead of the decimals of the secondary token, allowing secondary tokens > 18 decimals to slip through.

## Impact

Important security check bypassed, allowing explicitly incompatible tokens to be added

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rewrite require to check secondary decimals rather than primary

    -    require(primaryDecimals <= 18);
    +    require(secondaryDecimals <= 18);
