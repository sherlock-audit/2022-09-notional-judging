# M-03 Incorrect "linear projection" for exponential math in calculating BPT value

## Summary

https://github.com/notional-finance/leveraged-vaults/blob/91b96a456a6ada5a7f73ecf420e4ac5bf6797b45/contracts/vaults/balancer/internal/pool/Boosted3TokenPoolUtils.sol#L203-L216

```solidity
        // NOTE: For Boosted 3 token pools, the LP token (BPT) is just another
        // token in the pool. So, we first use _calcTokenOutGivenExactBptIn
        // to calculate the value of 1 BPT. Then, we scale it to the BPT
        // amount to get the value in terms of the primary currency.
        // Use virtual total supply and zero swap fees for joins
        primaryAmount = StableMath._calcTokenOutGivenExactBptIn({
            amp: oracleContext.ampParam, 
            balances: balances, 
            tokenIndex: 0, 
            bptAmountIn: BalancerConstants.BALANCER_PRECISION, // 1 BPT 
            bptTotalSupply: virtualSupply, 
            swapFeePercentage: 0, 
            currentInvariant: invariant
        });
```


## Vulnerability Detail


BPT token value per fair math is going to be P t_n^wn / wn

Because of that, a linear approximation is not correct and instead price is dependent on size
Because all tools are available, a direct quote should be preferred over retrieving 1.

Alternatively a full derivation for Balancer Pool Token Pricing is available here: https://twitter.com/0xa9a/status/1539227193808629761/photo/1

## Impact

Because price derivation is linearly approximated, MEV is available by causing the strategy to miscalculate the assets it manages, extracting the difference

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use BPT derivation formula for the entire amount, do not use a linear approximation
