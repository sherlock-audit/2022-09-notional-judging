# M-02 wstETH Feed Doesn't check for Freshness

## Summary

The Price feed for wstETH is accepting the price at face value instead of checking for the recency of the oracle

## Vulnerability Detail

Feed may have not been updated due to network conditions.

The system may accept a price that is not consistent with reality, which would allow for MEV.

## Impact

MEV extraction as real price / AMM price vs accepted price is different, leading to arbitrage opportunities at the detriment of the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Apply a check for `updatedAt` being recent enough
