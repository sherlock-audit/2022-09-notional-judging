# ExchangeRate age not checked

## Summary
The age of exchange rates is not checked, which can result in situations where old exchange rates are used.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_calculateSecondaryDebt` calls `buildExchangeRate`, which queries the oracle. However, the `updatedAt` timestamp is ignored, meaning that the returned rate can be arbitrarily old.

## Impact
When the exchange rate was not updated in a long time, this enables arbitrage opportunities, as Notional is using a wrong exchange rate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the exchange rate is not too old.
