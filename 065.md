# `CrossCurrencyfCashVault` Cannot Be Upgraded

## Summary

`CrossCurrencyfCashVault` cannot be upgraded as it is missing the authorize upgrade method.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Cross Currency Vault is expected to be upgradeable as:

- This vault is similar to the other vaults (Boosted3TokenAuraVault and MetaStable2TokenAuraVault) provided by Notional that are upgradeable by default.
- The `BaseStrategyVault` has configured the storage gaps `uint256[45] private __gap` for upgrading purposes
- Clarified with the sponsor and noted that Cross Currency Vault should be upgradeable

`CrossCurrencyfCashVault` inherits from `BaseStrategyVault`.  However, the `BaseStrategyVault` forget to inherit Openzepplin's `UUPSUpgradeable` contract. Therefore, it is missing the authorize upgrade method, and the contract cannot be upgraded.

```solidity
abstract contract BaseStrategyVault is Initializable, IStrategyVault {
    using TokenUtils for IERC20;
    using TradeHandler for Trade;

    /// @notice Hardcoded on the implementation contract during deployment
    NotionalProxy public immutable NOTIONAL;
    ITradingModule public immutable TRADING_MODULE;
    uint8 constant internal INTERNAL_TOKEN_DECIMALS = 8;
    
    ..SNIP..
    
    // Storage gap for future potential upgrades
    uint256[45] private __gap;
 }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/CrossCurrencyfCashVault.sol#L32

```solidity
contract CrossCurrencyfCashVault is BaseStrategyVault {
    using TypeConvert for uint256;
    using TypeConvert for int256;

    uint256 public constant SETTLEMENT_SLIPPAGE_PRECISION = 1e18;

    struct DepositParams {
        // Minimum purchase amount of the lend underlying token, this is
        // based on the deposit + borrowed amount and must be set to a non-zero
        // value to establish a slippage limit.
        uint256 minPurchaseAmount;
        // Minimum annualized lending rate, can be set to zero for no slippage limit
        uint32 minLendRate;
        // ID of the desired DEX to trade on, _depositFromNotional will always trade
        // using an EXACT_IN_SINGLE trade which is supported by all DEXes
        uint16 dexId;
        // Exchange data depending on the selected dexId
        ..SNIP..
```

## Impact

If a critical bug is discovered within the Cross Currency Vault after launching that causes a loss of assets, the vault cannot be upgraded unlike the other balancer-related vaults to fix the bugs. All assets within the vault will be lost

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to Inherit Openzepplin's `UUPSUpgradeable` contract and implement the missing authorize upgrade method.
