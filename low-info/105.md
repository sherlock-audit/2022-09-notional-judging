# Attacker can make settleVaultNormal unavailable by increasing cooldown period

## Summary
Attacker can increase the cooldown period in such a way that settleVaultNormal is never available and users would need to resort to post maturity settlement

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Attacker call settleVaultNormal (could keep 0 strategyTokensToRedeem)
2. This extends lastSettlementTimestamp to current block timestamp

```python
context.baseStrategy.vaultState.lastSettlementTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
```

3. Now user wont be able to settle vault normally till cooldown period is reached

```python
SettlementUtils._validateCoolDown(
            context.baseStrategy.vaultState.lastSettlementTimestamp,
            context.baseStrategy.vaultSettings.settlementCoolDownInMinutes
        );
```

4. Once cooldown period is over, Attacker immediately again repeat previous step 1-3 making this function completely unavailable for normal users

## Impact
Users wont be able to settle vault normally and will be forced to wait till maturity in order to use post maturity settlement

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
lastSettlementTimestamp should be user specific which will make the cooldown period also tied to user thus solving this issue
