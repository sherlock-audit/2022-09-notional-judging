# CurveAdapter.sol does support function exchange_underlying method.

## Summary

CurveAdapter.sol does support function exchange_underlying method.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation of the CurveAdapter.sol only support the function exchange

```solidity
       return (
            address(pool),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                ICurvePool.exchange.selector,
                i,
                j,
                trade.amount,
                trade.limit
            )
        );
```

however, there is limitation

From Curve Documentation

> Like plain pools, lending pools have the exchange method. However, in the case of lending pools, calling exchange performs a swap between two wrapped tokens in the pool.

> For example, calling exchange on the Compound Pool, would result in a swap between the wrapped tokens cDAI and cUSDC.

in this case, the function

```solidity
StableSwap.exchange_underlying(i: int128, j: int128, dx: uint256, min_dy: uint256)→ uint256[](https://curve.readthedocs.io/exchange-pools.html#StableSwap.exchange_underlying)
```

comes in handy.

the function Perform an exchange between two underlying tokens. Index values can be found via the underlying_coins public getter method.

## Impact

Missing the function exchange_underlying method make the CurveAdapter.sol support only wrapped token but not underlying token.
