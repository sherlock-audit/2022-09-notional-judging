# Approve Returned Value Not Validated

## Summary

The returned value of an `approve()` call is not validated.

## Vulnerability Detail

During vault initialization, it will attempt to perform `tokenAddress.approve` to allow Notional to pull the lend underlying currency at Line 100. However, it does not check the `success` return value. Some tokens do not revert if the approval failed but return false instead.

```solidity
File: CrossCurrencyfCashVault.sol
079:     function initialize(
080:         string memory name_,
081:         uint16 borrowCurrencyId_,
082:         uint16 lendCurrencyId_,
083:         uint64 settlementSlippageLimit_
084:     ) external initializer {
085:         __INIT_VAULT(name_, borrowCurrencyId_);
086: 
087:         LEND_CURRENCY_ID = lendCurrencyId_;
088:         (
089:             Token memory assetToken,
090:             Token memory underlyingToken,
091:             /* ETHRate memory ethRate */,
092:             /* AssetRateParameters memory assetRate */
093:         ) = NOTIONAL.getCurrencyAndRates(lendCurrencyId_);
094: 
095:         IERC20 tokenAddress = assetToken.tokenType == TokenType.NonMintable ?
096:             IERC20(assetToken.tokenAddress) : IERC20(underlyingToken.tokenAddress);
097:         LEND_UNDERLYING_TOKEN = tokenAddress;
098: 
099:         // Allow Notional to pull the lend underlying currency
100:         tokenAddress.approve(address(NOTIONAL), type(uint256).max);
101: 
102:         // This value cannot be greater than 1e18
103:         require(settlementSlippageLimit_ < SETTLEMENT_SLIPPAGE_PRECISION);
104:         settlementSlippageLimit = settlementSlippageLimit_;
105:     }
```

## Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the approve and return `false` might be counted as a correct approve. Thus, the function might proceed with the execution and assume that there is sufficient allowance to work with. This might result in a revert at the later stage of the execution when the code notice that there is insufficient allowance during transfer causing features within the vault to stop working.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the return value of ERC20 approve operation to validate that they were successfully completed.
