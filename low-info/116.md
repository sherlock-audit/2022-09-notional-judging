# Deployments.BALANCER_VAULT.swap uint256 amonutsOut return value not handled in BalancerUtils.sol

## Summary

Maturity validation check is missing in VaultAccount.sol if fCashToBorrow is larger than 0 

## Vulnerability Detail

currently, in BalanerUtils.sol the _swapGiveIn just use the before and after token balance to check the token received.

```solidity
        amountOut = IERC20(tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));
        Deployments.BALANCER_VAULT.swap({
            singleSwap: IBalancerVault.SingleSwap({
                poolId: poolId,
                kind: IBalancerVault.SwapKind.GIVEN_IN,
                assetIn: IAsset(tokenIn),
                assetOut: IAsset(tokenOut),
                amount: amountIn,
                userData: new bytes(0)
            }),
            funds: IBalancerVault.FundManagement({
                sender: address(this),
                fromInternalBalance: false,
                recipient: payable(address(this)),
                toInternalBalance: false
            }),
            limit: limit,
            deadline: block.timestamp
        });
        amountOut = IERC20(tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this)) - amountOut;
```

however, the function Deployments.BALANCER_VAULT.swap returns amountsOut, the function does not properly handle the return value

According to the code of the balancer  Pool Vault Implementation.

https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/2c4d727bb30d66392bab7aae1019f389fe2d03a6/pkg/vault/contracts/Swaps.sol#L70

```solidity
   whenNotPaused
   authenticateFor(funds.sender)
   returns (uint256 amountCalculated)
```

the amountCalculated can be used with the before and after balance together to verify the token amount received is valid

## Impact

Without handling the return value of the function swap, it is possible that we receive less than expected amount of token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project handle the return value from the swap and use the returned amountsOut with the before and after balance to validate the transactions.

For example, if the amoutnsOut is 100, the difference between the before and after balance is 50, we know something is wrong and transaction should be reverted.
