# Two functions in TradingModule.sol both use initializer modifiers, one of the initializer will fail and contract will be not be initialized properly.

## Summary

Initializer modifiers are used twice in constructor and in initialize function in TradingModule.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

The constructor for TradingModule.sol use the initializer modifier

The function initialize inside the TradingModule.sol also use initializer modifier.

But a smart contract can only call initializer once. The second initializer function call will fail

> However, while Solidity ensures that a constructor is called only once in the lifetime of a contract, a regular function can be called many times. To prevent a contract from being initialized multiple times, you need to add a check to ensure the initialize function is called only once:

> Since this pattern is very common when writing upgradeable contracts, OpenZeppelin Contracts provides an Initializable base contract that has an initializer modifier that takes care of this.

## Impact

function call

```solidity
function initialize(uint32 maxOracleFreshnessInSeconds_) initializer
``` 

will fails

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project only use initializer modifier once and complete all the initialization inside the function because contract inherits UUPSUpgradeable proxy.

```solidity
function initialize
```
