# UniV2Adapter.sol does not implement swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens

## Summary

UniV2Adapter.sol does not support fee on transfer token, because it does not swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens function call.

## Vulnerability Detail

Uniswap is considered the dominant AMM protocol. While Uniswap V3's innovation is advanced, Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V2 related fork still takes a considerable amount of shares.

The integration with UniswapV2 should not be taken for granted. 

In the current implementation,

the UniswapV2Adapter only support regular ERC20 token swap by supporting

```solidity
        executionCallData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                IUniV2Router2.swapExactTokensForTokens.selector,
                trade.amount,
                trade.limit,
                data.path,
                from,
                trade.deadline
        );
```

However, swapExactTokensForTokens fails if the underlying token is fee on transfer token.

there is a special transfer function that takes care of the fee on transfer token in UniswapV2.sol, which is not supported at this time.

```solidity
function swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
  uint amountIn,
  uint amountOutMin,
  address[] calldata path,
  address to,
  uint deadline
) external;
```

> Identical to [swapExactTokensForTokens](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/reference/smart-contracts/router-02#swapexacttokensfortokens), but succeeds for tokens that take a fee on transfer.

## Impact

lack of such support for fee on transfer token would means that when strategy vault execute trade, fee on transfer token will be left off in UniswapV2 in 

```solidity
    /// @notice Can be used to delegate call to the TradingModule's implementation in order to execute
    /// a trade.
    function _executeTrade(
        uint16 dexId,
        Trade memory trade
    ) internal returns (uint256 amountSold, uint256 amountBought) {
        return trade._executeTrade(dexId, TRADING_MODULE);
    }
```

## Recommendation

We recommand the project add swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens support for Uniswap V2
