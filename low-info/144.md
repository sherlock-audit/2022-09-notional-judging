# User will Lose Ether when sending `msg.value` to vault with `tokenType` not being Ether

## Summary
It is possible for a user to accidently send ETH when executing `VaultAccountAction.sol's` `enterVault()` and `rollVaultPosition()` even though the vault's `tokenType` is not Ether. 
When the vault's `tokenType` is not Ether, there is no meaning of sending ETH so user can lose their ETH accidentally.

## Vulnerability Detail
`VaultAccountAction.sol's` `enterVault()` and `rollVaultPosition()` is payable but when the vault's tokenType is not Ether,
there is no meaning for user to send ETH. However there is no check for msg.value when tokenType is NOT Ether, so it is possible
for user to send ETH accidentally and losing their fund.

## Impact
User will lose their Ether.

## Code Snippet
User can send ETH since `enterVault()` and `rollVaultPosition()` is payable

For `enterVault()` function, it will do an external call to `vaultConfig.transferUnderlyingToVaultDirect` where there is
no check of msg.value when tokenType is NOT Ether.

For `rollVaultPosition()` function, it will do an external call to `vaultAccount.depositForRollPosition` where there is
not check of msg.value when tokenType is NOT Ether.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add check of whether `msg.value` is zero or not when `tokenType` is NOT Ether
```
require(msg.value == 0);
```
