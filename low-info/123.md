# slippage protection is disabled because the trade limit is hardcoded to 0 when Sell residual secondary balance in_executeDynamicTradeExactIn in StragetyUtils.sol

## Summary

slippage protection is disabled because the trade limit is hardcoded to 0 when Sell residual secondary balance in_executeDynamicTradeExactIn in StragetyUtils.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

in the _executeDynamicTradeExactIn in 

when we Sell residual secondary balance after unwrap the STETH,

the trade limit is hardcoded to 0, the trade limit is used as a slippage protection.

```solidity
        // Sell residual secondary balance
        Trade memory trade = Trade(
            params.tradeType,
            sellToken,
            buyToken,
            amount,
            0,
            block.timestamp, // deadline
            params.exchangeData
        );
```

the trade struct is 

```solidity

struct Trade {
    TradeType tradeType;
    address sellToken;
    address buyToken;
    uint256 amount;
    /// minBuyAmount or maxSellAmount
    uint256 limit;
    uint256 deadline;
    bytes exchangeData;
}
```

the fifith parameter: limit, in this case is hardcoded to 0,

then the Sell residual secondary balance has no slippage protection and is vulnerable to sandwich attack and front-running from MEV bot.

## Impact

then the Sell residual secondary balance has no slippage protection and is vulnerable to sandwich attack and front-running from MEV bot.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project not hardcode trade limit to 0 to disable the slippage protection. The project can specify the min percentage amount of token received if we do not know the trade limit.
