# `AuraStakingMixin.claimRewardTokens()` might revert for some edge cases.

## Summary
`AuraStakingMixin.claimRewardTokens()` might revert for some edge cases.

## Vulnerability Detail
`AuraStakingMixin.claimRewardTokens()` might revert for some edge cases.

Currently, it transfers the `feeAmount` to `FEE_RECEIVER` for each rewardToken [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/mixins/AuraStakingMixin.sol#L72-L81).

```solidity
AURA_REWARD_POOL.getReward(address(this), true);
for (uint256 i; i < numRewardTokens; i++) {
    claimedBalances[i] = rewardTokens[i].balanceOf(address(this)) - claimedBalances[i];

    if (claimedBalances[i] > 0 && feePercentage != 0 && FEE_RECEIVER != address(0)) {
        uint256 feeAmount = claimedBalances[i] * feePercentage / BalancerConstants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS;
        rewardTokens[i].checkTransfer(FEE_RECEIVER, feeAmount); //@audit-transfer0
        claimedBalances[i] -= feeAmount;
    }
}
```

Btw such transfers might revert for some reason.
- First, it doesn't check if `feeAmount != 0` before transferring the fee. 
- Even if `claimedBalances[i] > 0 && feePercentage != 0`, it's possible `feeAmount == 0` with the low balance and `feePercentage`, and some tokens don't allow 0-transfer as we can see [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers).
- The above case will be likely to happen when the token has low decimals.
- Second, the `FEE_RECEIVER` might be blacklisted and the transfer failed as explained [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#tokens-with-blocklists).

## Impact
`claimRewardTokens()` might revert for some reason during fee transfer.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- For the first issue, we can check once more if `feeAmount > 0` before the transfer [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/mixins/AuraStakingMixin.sol#L78).
- For the second issue, we can record the fee amount for each token using the mapping and transfer later independently.
