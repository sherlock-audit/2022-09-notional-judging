# Duplicate reward can lead to deduction of extra fees than required

## Summary
In AuraStakingMixin contract, if _rewardTokens contains duplicate token then fees will be deducted twice instead of deducting it once.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the _rewardTokens method

```python
function _rewardTokens() private view returns (IERC20[] memory tokens) {
        uint256 rewardTokenCount = LIQUIDITY_GAUGE.reward_count() + 2;
        tokens = new IERC20[](rewardTokenCount);
        tokens[0] = BAL_TOKEN;
        tokens[1] = AURA_TOKEN;
        for (uint256 i = 2; i < rewardTokenCount; i++) {
            tokens[i] = IERC20(LIQUIDITY_GAUGE.reward_tokens(i - 2));
        }
    }
```

2. As we can see 2 tokens BAL and AURA are hardcoded and rest tokens are coming from LIQUIDITY_GAUGE.reward_tokens
3. The problem arises if LIQUIDITY_GAUGE.reward_tokens has one of the token as BAL or AURA. 
4. In the case of duplicate token claimRewardTokens will deduct fees twice for each instance of copy leading to giving excess fees than required

```python
for (uint256 i; i < numRewardTokens; i++) {
            claimedBalances[i] = rewardTokens[i].balanceOf(address(this)) - claimedBalances[i];

            if (claimedBalances[i] > 0 && feePercentage != 0 && FEE_RECEIVER != address(0)) {
                uint256 feeAmount = claimedBalances[i] * feePercentage / BalancerConstants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS;
                rewardTokens[i].checkTransfer(FEE_RECEIVER, feeAmount);
                claimedBalances[i] -= feeAmount;
            }
        }
```

## Impact
More fees than required will be deducted reducing the claimable balance
