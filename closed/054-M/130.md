# one maturity could exhaust `VaultBorrowCapacity`

## Summary

`VaultBorrowCapacity` is used for all maturities in a vault. One or a few maturity could exhaust the capacity.

## Vulnerability Detail

All maturities in a vault share a borrow capacity. So if one maturity borrows too much then other maturities in the same vault cannot borrow anymore. 

## Impact

If `totalUsedBorrowCapacity` reach `maxBorrowCapacity`, no one can borrow anymore

Set a reasonable individual borrow capacity for all the maturities in one vault.
