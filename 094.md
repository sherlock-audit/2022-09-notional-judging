# Usage of deprecated transfer() can result in revert, BaseStrategyVault.sol usage of payable(address).transfer, not _to.call{value: msg.value}("") when handling ETH transfer

## Summary

The function redeemFromNotional in BaseStrategyVault.sol is used to redeem the notional ETH payment.

## Vulnerability Detail

in the function redeemFromNotional,

Usage of deprecated transfer() can result in revert,

```solidity
      if (_UNDERLYING_IS_ETH) {
            if (transferToReceiver > 0) payable(receiver).transfer(transferToReceiver);
            if (transferToNotional > 0) payable(address(NOTIONAL)).transfer(transferToNotional);
        } else {
            if (transferToReceiver > 0) _UNDERLYING_TOKEN.checkTransfer(receiver, transferToReceiver);
            if (transferToNotional > 0) _UNDERLYING_TOKEN.checkTransfer(address(NOTIONAL), transferToNotional);
        }
```

transfer() uses a fixed amount of gas, which was used to prevent reentrancy. However this limit your protocol to interact with others contracts that need more than that to process the transaction.

Specifically, the withdrawal will inevitably fail when: 1.The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function. 2.The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units. 3.The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.

## Impact

## Recommendation

Use call instead of transfer(). Example: (bool succeeded, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}(""); require(succeeded, "Transfer failed.");
