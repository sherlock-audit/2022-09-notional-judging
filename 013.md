# `requireValidAccount` does not prevent the vault address itself from opening a position

## Summary
`requireValidAccount` does not prevent a vault from opening a position in its own vault

## Vulnerability Detail
`requireValidAccount` is called from `enterVault` in `VaultAccountAction.sol` used to ensure that:

> These accounts cannot receive deposits, transfers, fCash or any other types of value transfers

where the accounts in question are: the reserve address (aka `address(0)`), the `VaultAccountAction` contract address, and any `nToken` contract address. This list, however, does not include the vault address itself.

## Impact
If the vault address were to open a position on itself, that could cause undefined behavior on the state of the vault.

## Code Snippet
Failing test case (add to `tests/stateful/vaults/test_vault_entry.py`):
```python3
def test_no_entry_vault_address(environment, vault, accounts):
    environment.notional.updateVault(
        vault.address,
        get_vault_config(flags=set_flags(0, ENABLED=True), currencyId=2),
        100_000_000e8,
    )
    maturity = environment.notional.getActiveMarkets(1)[0][1]
    with brownie.reverts():
        environment.notional.enterVault(
            vault.address,
            vault.address,
            0,
            maturity,
            0,
            0,
            "",
            {"from": vault.address},
        )
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the following `require` statement to `enterVault`:
```solidity
require(account != vault);
```
