# Accounts cannot raise their collateral if vault is paused

## Summary
When a vault is paused, accounts cannot raise their collateral to avoid liquidation

## Vulnerability Detail
`VaultAccountAction.enterVault()` is not only used by users who wish to borrow, it can also be used to raise their collateral ratio if they are close to liquidation by passing `fCashToBorrow == 0`. But if a vault is paused, the function will revert because of the check [line 54](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/cf05d8e3e4e4feb0b0cef2c3f188c91cdaac38e0/contracts/external/actions/VaultAccountAction.sol#L54).

## Impact
When a vault is paused, a user close to liquidation will not be able to raise their collateral, which means they have no way to avoid liquidation as their loan approaches undercollateralization.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`VaultAccountAction.enterVault` should check the vault enabled/disabled status only if `fCash > 0` - ie in the case the account is borrowing.

```diff
+if (fCash > 0) {
54        require(vaultConfig.getFlag(VaultConfiguration.ENABLED), "Cannot Enter");
+}
```
