# Unexpected behavior for UniV2Adapter, UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter when msgValue is not zero

## Summary
Unexpected behavior for UniV2Adapter, UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter when msgValue is not zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
UniV2Adapter, UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter are assuming msgValue is zero. But the caller logic is shared between BalancerV2Adapter and CurveAdapter which support positive msgValue. So, there is a chance that UniV2Adapter, UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter will be given positive msgValue. Since they don't handled positive msgValue cases, it will return an unexpected behavior.

## Impact
If msgValue is not zero, UniV2Adapter, UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter may execute unexpected behavior. For example, UniV2Adapter may swap WETH to tokens instead of swapping native ETH to tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert when msgValue is not zero

```solidity
 function getExecutionData(address from, Trade calldata trade) 
     internal view returns ( 
         address spender, 
         address target, 
         uint256 msgValue, 
         bytes memory executionCallData 
     ) 
 {
   ...
   require(msgValue == 0, "Positive msgValue");
   ...
 }
```
