# `CrossCurrencyfCashVault` Cannot Settle Its Assets In Pieces

## Summary

The `CrossCurrencyfCashVault` vault cannot settle its assets in pieces. Thus, it might cause the vault to incur unnecessary slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The settle vault function is designed in a manner where its assets can be settled in pieces. Therefore, the `settleVault` function accepts a `strategyTokens` or `strategyTokensToRedeem` parameter to allow the caller to specify the number of strategy tokens to be settled.

The reason as mentioned in Notional's walkthrough video (Refer to the explanation at [15.50min](https://youtu.be/GZJvLqUzK_0?t=940) mark) is that in some cases the caller might want to break down into multiple transactions due to massive slippage.

For instance, the vault might utilize a 2 day settlement period to allow the vault to settle its assets in pieces so that it can avoid unnecessary transaction costs associated with converting all its assets back to USDC in a single transaction.

121:     function settleVault(uint256 maturity, uint256 strategyTokens, bytes calldata settlementTrade) external {
122:         require(maturity <= block.timestamp, "Cannot Settle");
123:         VaultState memory vaultState = NOTIONAL.getVaultState(address(this), maturity);
124:         require(vaultState.isSettled == false);
125:         require(vaultState.totalStrategyTokens >= strategyTokens);
126: 
127:         RedeemParams memory params = abi.decode(settlementTrade, (RedeemParams));
128:     
129:         // The only way for underlying value to be negative would be if the vault has somehow ended up with a borrowing
130:         // position in the lend underlying currency. This is explicitly prevented during redemption.
131:         uint256 underlyingValue = convertStrategyToUnderlying(
132:             address(0), vaultState.totalStrategyTokens, maturity
133:         ).toUint();
134: 
135:         // Authenticate the minimum purchase amount, all tokens will be sold given this slippage limit.
136:         uint256 minAllowedPurchaseAmount = (underlyingValue * settlementSlippageLimit) / SETTLEMENT_SLIPPAGE_PRECISION;
137:         require(params.minPurchaseAmount >= minAllowedPurchaseAmount, "Purchase Limit");
138: 
139:         NOTIONAL.redeemStrategyTokensToCash(maturity, strategyTokens, settlementTrade);
140: 
141:         // If there are no more strategy tokens left, then mark the vault as settled
142:         vaultState = NOTIONAL.getVaultState(address(this), maturity);
143:         if (vaultState.totalStrategyTokens == 0) {
144:             NOTIONAL.settleVault(address(this), maturity);
145:         }
146:     }
```

During vault settlement, the `CrossCurrencyfCashVault._redeemFromNotional` function will be called, and the code in lines 252-262 will be executed. However, it was observed that the `strategyTokens` parameter is ignored, and the vault will forcefully settle all the strategy tokens in one go. As such, there is no way for the caller to break down the settle vault transaction into multiple transactions.

```

## Impact

The vault might incur unnecessary slippage during settlement as the settlement cannot be broken into multiple transactions.

## Recommended

It is recommended to update the `CrossCurrencyfCashVault._redeemFromNotional` function to allow the vault to be settled in multiple transactions.
