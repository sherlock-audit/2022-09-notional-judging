# `BalancerUtils::_normalizeBalances` will silently underflow if decimals are bigger than 18

## Summary

If `primaryDecimals` or `secondaryDecimals` is bigger than 18, the `BalancerUtils::_normalizeBalances` will silently underflow and gives very wrong number.

## Vulnerability Detail

If `primaryDecimals` or `secondaryDecimals` is bigger than 18, the `BalancerUtils::_normalizeBalances` will silently underflow and gives very wrong number.
For example, if the primaryDecimals is 24, the `18 - primaryDecimals` will wrap around within uint8 and be 250, then the `decimalAdjust` will be 103127329476984736549117908523362667931818580092836127347641910757047631085568.

## Impact

The `_normalizeBalances` will return incorrect values for tokens with bigger than 18 decimals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Even if the contract is not meant to be used with bigger than 18 decimals, add a check to revert if the decimals are too big.
