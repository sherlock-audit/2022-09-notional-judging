# One vault can enter another vault

## Summary
The ALLOW_REENTRANCY flag, if turned on, can disable reentrancy protection of selected vaults. However there is no check to see that these selected vaults are not reentering the reentrancy protected vaults

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume there are 2 vaults A,B where vault A has ALLOW_REENTRANCY as true
2. User calls [enterVault](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/cf05d8e3e4e4feb0b0cef2c3f188c91cdaac38e0/contracts/external/actions/VaultAccountAction.sol#L34) with Vault A
3. Since vaultConfig.getFlag(VaultConfiguration.ALLOW_REENTRANCY) is true for Vault A so Reentrancy is allowed
4. Since reentrancy is allowed for Vault A, reentrancyStatus is reset to _NOT_ENTERED. This means if this contract interact with any malicious contract then that contract can again call enterVault with Vault B address in mid way of execution even though this transaction should only allow Vault A

## Impact
You can reenter a protected vault from a non protected vault

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
One more flag should be added mentioning the Vault for which reentrancy was allowed, say vaultAllowed=A. On enterVault execution, if reentrancyStatus is _NOT_ENTERED then revert if vault!=vaultAllowed
