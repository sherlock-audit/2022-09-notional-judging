# `TradingUtils::_executeInternal` fail to approve WETH

## Summary

Upon using Uniswap for dex, and sellToken is ETH, WETH should be approved to Uniswap. However, it is not approved, therefore the trade will fail and gas spent for this transaction will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

Uniswap does not support ETH transfer, so the trading should be done by WETH.

If the sellToken is ETH, the uniswap adapter sets the `spender` as uniswap router, so it is not zero address. Thus, in the `TradingUtils::_executeInternal` (line 45 TradingUtils.sol), it calls `_approve`. The `TradingUtils::_approve` function (line 115) calls `TokenUtils::checkApprove`, which will just return if the token address is zero. In this case, the sellToken is ETH so the `_approve` will just return. So, at the end no WETH was approved to uniswap.

In the parameters to the uniswap, it is selling WETH, thus without the approval the trade will fail. 

## Impact

Any attempt to use Uniswap for selling ETH will fail. Users who tries to use it will lose gas and should use some other dex.

 19         if (address(token) == address(0)) return;

 21         IEIP20NonStandard(address(token)).approve(spender, amount);
 22         _checkReturnCode();

## Recommendation

For uniswap, when sellToken is ETH, approve.
